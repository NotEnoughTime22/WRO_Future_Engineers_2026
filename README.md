# SSTitans

This repository contains engineering materials of SSTactical's self-driven vehicle model that is competing in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the 2025 season.
## Content
* `Documents` contain the Engineering Journal of the team.
* `Models` contain the model files used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. [If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.]
   * `EVO Brick Model.stl` is the 3D model of the case holding our EvolutonX1 Brick.
   * `VL53L0X Lego Mount Model.stl` is the 3D model of a mount for our Time of Flight (ToF). 
* `Photos` contains 2 folder holding photos of the team and the vehicle.
   * `Team` ----- contains one photo of the team (an official one with all team members)
   * `Vehicle` ----- contains 2 folders of the vehicle at different stages (from every side, from top and bottom)
       ~ `First Prototype` ----- contains 9 images of the first prototype chassis
        - `Back side of first prototype chassis.jpeg` contains 1 photo of the back view of the first prototype chassis
        - `Bottom side of unfinished first prototype.jpeg` contains 1 photo of the bottom view of the unfinished first prototype chassis
        - `Comparison of first and second(Unfinished) chassis.jpeg` contains 1 photo of the comparision between the first and second prototype chassis
        - `Front side of first prototype chassis.jpeg` contains 1 photo of the front view of the first prototype chassis
        - `Left side of first prototype chassis.jpeg` contains 1 photo of the left view of the first prototype chassis
        - `Right side of first prototype chassis.jpeg` contains 1 photo of the right view of the first prototype chassis
        - `Right side of unfinished first prototype chassis.jpeg` contains 1 photo of the right view of the unfinished first prototype chassis
        - `Top-right side of unfinished first prototype chassis.jpeg` contains 1 photo of the top-right view of the unfinished first prototype
  * `Schemes` contains several schematic diagrams in the form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
   * `Microcontroller Wiring Diagram.png` contains a photo of our Microcontroller System Diagram.
   * `Overall System Wiring Diagram.png` contains a photo of our Overall System Wiring Diagram.
* `Software` contains the code of our software for all the components which were programmed to participate in the competition.
  * `Code` contains the code used to program the robot for each challenge.
    - `WRO_FE_Colour.ino` is the code for the challenge round.               
    - `WRO_FE_Open.ino` is the code for the preliminary round.        
  * `Library` contains each and every library used in the code.
    - `Library/Evo.zip` is our library required to run our microcontroller, with other external libraries in the folder.
    - `Library/External_libraries` is a folder containing all necessary .zip libraries to be added to the Arduino IDE in order for **EVERYTHING** to function.
## Introduction
# Usage
  * Install the libraries found in the Software/Library/External_libraries by going to the library manager in the Arduino IDE and installing each of them through the Add .ZIP Library. -- **ALL LIBRARIES ARE REQUIRED FOR THE CODE TO RUN CORRECTLY.**
  * ⁠ ⁠Install Software/Library/Evo.zip and follow the following on the Arduino IDE: Sketch --> Include Library --> Add .ZIP Library --> Select EvoEditted.zip.
  *  ⁠Open the desired file (i.e. WRO_FE_Colour.ino or WRO_FE_Open.ino) with the Arduino IDE.                    

## Reminders before running the bot:
* Software
   - Ensure that the bot is set to the ESP32-S3
   - Ensure all sensors have been calibrated to the competition venue environment

* Hardware
   - Check that every wire has been connected to the right spot
   - Check for faulty equipment and replace it if found
   - Structural Parts are intact and sturdy
   - Ensure that the wheels are not loose
   - Check for any steering fault

* Bot Placement
   - Make sure the bot is placed straight
